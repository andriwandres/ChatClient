<!-- How to setup application -->
## ðŸŽ¯ Getting started
Here's how you get this application running on your system.

### âœ… Prerequisites
Before launching the application, make sure that the below listed criterias are met.

#### Angular
For running the Angular application, you need a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version of at least 12.11.x or higher.
Also, make sure you have the latest version of the Angular CLI installed (11.0.3 or higher).

```shell
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

After installing the Angular CLI, you can also install the remaining dependencies required for this project.

```shell
# Navigate to the angular app's root directory
cd ChatClient/Presentation/Client/Presentation.Client

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

#### .NET Core
For running the ASP.NET Core application that serves the back-end, a [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) of Version 6.0.0 or higher is required. Alternatively, you can install [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads), which already ships with the required SDKs and lets you run the application seemlessly.

### ðŸ”¨ Running the application
You can open the solution file in Visual Studio 2019 and Run the startup project `Presentation.Api` in order to start the back-end application.

If you prefer using the `dotnet CLI` for running the application. Use the following commands in your command-line:
```shell
# Navigate to the startup project
cd ChatClient/Presentation/Api/Presentation.Api

# Start up the application
dotnet run
```
This should result in a new browser window displaying the Swagger documentation for the REST API. Also it should create a new SQL Server database on your personal LOCALDB server instance with all the necessary tables. If you cannot work with SQL Server, switch to another database provider like PostgreSQL or MySQL and run the application again.


After the back-end is up and running, you can open your command line and execute following commands to bootstrap the Angular front-end:
```
# Navigate to the Angular app's root folder
cd ChatClient/Presentation/Client/Presentation.Client

# Run the application
ng serve --hmr --open
```
This will open a new browser window on `localhost:4200` with the served Angular application.

The back-end is built ontop of the .NET Core ecosystem and serves as a web API with a purely RESTful design. It utilizes design patterns such as CQRS and Domain-Driven-Design. For realizing chat-like functionality, it also uses web sockets for Server-To-Client communication. The database provider of choice is SQL Server. For querying and mutating database records, the Object-relational mapper Entity Framework Core is used.

The front-end is built as a Single-Page-Application using the Angular Framework from Google. It uses a state management solution similar to Redux for persisting local state. The design pattern follows mostly Google's material design, with a few exceptions here and there.
